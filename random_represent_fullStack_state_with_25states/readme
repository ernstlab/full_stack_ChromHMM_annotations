This folder contains code that were used to produce the results presented in Additional File 1: Fig. S9 (Estimated probabilities of concatenated-model chromatin states overlapping with full-stack states.).
We created a snakemake pipeline for this analysis. Therefore, if you want to reproduce this analysis, you will only need to update the Snakefile at places marked with '# TO BE UPDATED' (we already provided instructions on how to update these lines of code in the Snakefile). Then, you can run this pipeline using snakemake. You can also run the pipeline in parallel where possible, and snakemake can take care of all the job-sitting work for you. Please contact us (havu73@ucla.edu) if you run into any problems or need help modifying/ getting started with snakemake.
