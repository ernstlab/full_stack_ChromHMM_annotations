MissingOutputException in line 64 of /u/project/ernst/havu73/source/25state_enrichments/random_represent_fullStack_state_with_25states/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job count_sample_region_per_state since they might be corrupted:
../../../ROADMAP_aligned_reads/chromHMM_model/model_100_state/enrichment_151825_roadmap_chromState/sample_segment_overlap_25state/sample_state_sorted_by_group.txt.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
