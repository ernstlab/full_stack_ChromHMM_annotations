- File <a href="https://public.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/ernst/1G6UT/hg19_genome_100_segments.bed.gz">hg19_genome_100_segments.bed.gz</a> contains a simple four column .bed file of full-stack state annotation in hg19 assembly. Since our training data (1032 input data tracks) are in hg19, the assembly used for original training and annotation. The fourth column contains a state label with a prefix number that can be used to order the states. The OverlapEnrichment and NeighborhoodEnrichment commands of ChromHMM with the '-labels' option can compute enrichments for this file and order states based on the prefix number.
- File <a href="https://public.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/ernst/1G6UT/hg19_genome_100_browser.bed.gz">hg19_genome_100_browser.bed.gz</a> contains a browser file of full-stack state annotation in hg19 assembly. This file is compatible to for UCSC genome browser. Since our training data (1032 input data tracks) are in hg19, the assembly used for original training and annotation.
- File <a href="https://public.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/ernst/1G6UT/hg38lift_genome_100_segments.bed.gz">hg38lift_genome_100_segments.bed.gz</a> is similar to hg19_genome_100_segments.bed.gz, but based on a liftOver of each 200bp bin to hg38. Positions mapped to from multiple locations in hg19 did not receive an annotation. Since the 200-bp intervals are no longer maintained when using OverlapEnrichment and NeighborhoodEnrichment the options '-b' and '-lowmmem' should be used with this command in addition to the '-labels' option as with the hg19 file.
- File <a href="https://public.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/ernst/1G6UT/hg38lift_genome_100_browser.bed.gz">hg38lift_genome_100_browser.bed.gz</a> is similar to hg19_genome_100_browser.bed.gz but is for the liftOver to hg38. Positions mapped to from multiple locations in hg19 did not receive an annotation.
