Data of full-stack genome annotations for reference assemblies hg19 and hg38 can be found at: https://public.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/ernst/2K9RS//full_stack/full_stack_annotations
Within this folder:
- File hg19_genome_100_segments.bed.gz contains data of full-stack state annotation in hg19 assembly. This file is compatible to for UCSC genome browser. Since our training data (1032 input data tracks) are in hg19, this annotation is the raw output of ChromHMM when we trained the full-stack model.
- File hg38_genome_100_segments.bed.gz contains data of full-stack state annotation in hg38 assembly. This annotation is obtained by (1) Rewriting the annotation in hg19_genome_100_segments.bed.gz such that each row in the file will correspond to a region length 200bp (for example, if the first line is 'chr1 0 600 TSS1' then this step to transform this line into the first 3 lines), (2) Mapping the 200-bp regions from hg19 to hg38.
- File hg38_genome_100_segments_no_regions_mapped_from_multiple_hg19_ucsc.bed.gz contains data of full-stack state annotation in hg38 that has been corrected further compared to file hg38_genome_100_segments.bed.gz. In particular, the data in file hg38_genome_100_segments.bed.gz contains a few regions in alternative chromosomes (6244 200-bp regions in chromosomes chr12_GL877875v1_alt, chr14_GL000009v2_random, chr14_KI270846v1_alt, chr15_KI270850v1_alt, chr17_KI270857v1_alt, chr17_KI270909v1_alt, chr19_KI270938v1_alt, chr1_KI270706v1_random, chr1_KI270765v1_alt, chr1_KI270766v1_alt, chr22_KI270879v1_alt, chr2_KI270772v1_alt, chr2_KI270773v1_alt, chr2_KI270894v1_alt, chr4_GL000008v2_random, chr7_KI270803v1_alt, chr8_KI270821v1_alt, chrUn_KI270742v1). This file hg38_genome_100_segments_no_regions_mapped_from_multiple_hg19_ucsc.bed.gz only includes full-stack annotations in chromosome 1 --> 22, X, Y. Additionally, this file eradicates the bases of annotation in hg38 that were mapped from multiple distinct regions in hg19.
