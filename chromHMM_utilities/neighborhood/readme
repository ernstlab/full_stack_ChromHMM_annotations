This folder contains codes useful for understanding patterns of full-stack states' neighborhood enrichments around annotated TSS and TES (Fig. 3D and E, and Fig. S12)
- draw_2DLine_neighborhood_enrichment.R: Draw figures 3DE, each state's neighborhood enrichment is drawn in one line. Terminal command: Rscript draw_2DLine_neighborhood_enrichment.R tss_fn (output from ChromHMM NeighborhoodEnrichment around TSS), save_tss_fn (where the output figure for neighbood enrichment around TSS is stored.), tes_fn (output from ChromHMM NeighborhoodEnrichment around TES), save_tes_fn (where the output figure for neighbood enrichment around TES is stored.)
- draw_neighborhood_enrichment.R: Draw Fig. S12AB. each state's neighborhood enrichment is drawn in one row of the heatmap. Terminal command: Rscript draw_2DLine_neighborhood_enrichment.R input_enr_fn (output from ChromHMM NeighborhoodEnrichment around TSS/TES), save_fn (where the output figure for neighbood enrichment around TSS/TES is stored.)
- Required R packages: tidyverse, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, pheatmap
