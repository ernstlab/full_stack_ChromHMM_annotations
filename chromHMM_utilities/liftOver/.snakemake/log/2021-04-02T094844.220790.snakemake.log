MissingOutputException in line 43 of /u/project/ernst/havu73/source/chromHMM_utilities/liftOver/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
temp_raw_end_chr17.gz
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
