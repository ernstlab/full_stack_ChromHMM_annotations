This folder contains files that are useful for liftOver the full-stack state annotations from hg19 to a target assembly (the paper used liftOver to produce full-stack annotations for hg38), only for chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, M. We used snakemake to manage the whole pipeline. In order to reproduce the results, you will need to fill in the lines marked with comments '<TO_BE_FILLED>' in the Snakefile (only 3 lines), specifying some relative file paths local to your computer. The file Snakefile contains comments with instructions for you to fill in this code.
If you try to reproduce the results of liftOver, we recommend running snakemake using a high-performance computer cluster in parallel. 
|__Snakefile: specifying the pipeline used to liftOver full-stack state annotations from hg19 to a target assembly. Please modify 3 lines in this file to reproduce the results (see above and see the file itself). 
|__change_segmentation_to_200bp_segmentation_for_liftOver.py: code used as part of the pipeline, called inside Snakefile. 
|__find_overlapping_segments_from_liftOver_one_chrom.py: code used as part of the pipeline, called inside Snakefile.
