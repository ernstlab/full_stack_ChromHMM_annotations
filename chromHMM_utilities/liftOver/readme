This folder contains files that are useful for liftOver the full-stack state annotations from hg19 to a target assembly (the paper used liftOver to produce full-stack annotations for hg38), only for chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, M. We used snakemake to manage the whole pipeline. In order to reproduce the results, you will need to fill in the lines marked with comments '<TO_BE_FILLED>' in the Snakefile (only 3 lines), specifying some relative file paths local to your computer. The file Snakefile contains comments with instructions for you to fill in this code.
If you try to reproduce the results of liftOver, we recommend running snakemake using a high-performance computer cluster in parallel. 
|__Snakefile: specifying the pipeline used to liftOver full-stack state annotations from hg19 to a target assembly. Please modify 3 lines in this file to reproduce the results (see above and see the file itself). 
|__change_segmentation_to_200bp_segmentation_for_liftOver.py: code used as part of the pipeline, called inside Snakefile. 
|__clean_overlapping_bases_and_compress.py: code used as part of the pipline to eradicate all bases in the destination assembly (such as hg38) that were mapped from multiple bases in the origin assembly (such as hg19)
|__compress_segmentation_data.py: code used as part of the pipeline to compress the output segmentation file from 200-bp segments into multiple-bin segments such that consecutive bins of the same states are put together into one line in the output bed file. Called inside the file clean_overlapping_bases_and_compress.py
